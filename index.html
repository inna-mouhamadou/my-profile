			 I am very creative and crafty. I love art, fashion and good food (who doesn't?). I created Inna's Illustrations and Inna's Crochet to share my beautiful creations with the world.

		 <div class="card-white">
			 <h2>Fashion Illustration</h2>
			 <p>
			 I've been drawing for as long as I could hold a pencil. As I grew up, I got interested in fashion and discovered many inspiring fashion illustrators on social media. That's how my illustration journey started.

		 	 <h2>Crochet</h3>
			 <p>
			 I initially learned how to crochet during my last year of primary school as an extra-curricular activity. After a few years, I picked my crochet hook up again in january 2021 to make a top. I rediscovered this craft that I had completely forgotten about and now it is one of my favorite hobbies.

		  <!--passion 3: Food-->
		 <div class="card-white">
		 	 <h2>Food</h2>
			 <p>
			 Since very young, I've always enjoyed food. Later, I eventually started cooking and baking at home. Ever since I've moved to Paris in August 2020, I made it my new mission to try as many restaurants as possible.
